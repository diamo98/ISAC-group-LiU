/item**Abstract of the paper.** This paper introduces a novel scheme inspired by the 5th generation (5G) synchronization signal block (\Gls{ssb}) cell-search procedure to simultaneously detect low-altitude drones within a predefined three-dimensional surveillance volume. We adopt a multistatic approach, where multiple access points (APs) collaborate to perform detection while independently transmitting \Gls{ssb} broadcast signals through beam sweeping. In the proposed scheme, coordinated APs send sensing beams toward a grid of points within the three-dimensional volume in a time-multiplexed manner. The 5G \Gls{ssb} burst is precoded using sweeping beams, with the sensing precoder selected to be orthogonal to \Gls{ssb} and to maximize the sensing signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio while ensuring an acceptable signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the user equipment and minimizing the impact of the direct link. The detection performance of the proposed precoder is evaluated under different radar cross section (RCS) models and altitudes of the grid of points.
