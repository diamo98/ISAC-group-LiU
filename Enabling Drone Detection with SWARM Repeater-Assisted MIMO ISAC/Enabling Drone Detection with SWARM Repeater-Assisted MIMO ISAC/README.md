**Abstract of the paper.** As definitions about new architectural aspects, use cases, and standards for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) continue to appear, cellular systems based on massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology are also experiencing a parallel evolution through the integration of novel network components. This evolution should support emerging ISAC use cases and services. In particular, this paper explores a recent vision for cost-efficient cellular network densification through the deployment of swarms of repeaters. Leveraging their ability to retransmit signals instantaneously, we investigate how these repeaters can enhance radar sensing capabilities for drone detection in a swarm repeater-assisted MIMO ISAC system. Our results demonstrate that, by optimizing the gains of repeaters given a sufficient maximum amplification gain, increasing the number of repeaters can lead to gains in sensing performance.
