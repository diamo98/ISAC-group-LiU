/item**Abstract of the paper.** This paper introduces a scheme for drone surveillance coordinated with the fifth generation (5G) \gls{ssb} cell-search procedure to simultaneously detect low-altitude drones within a volumetric surveillance grid. Herein, we consider a multistatic configuration where multiple access points (APs) collaboratively illuminate the volume while independently transmitting \Gls{ssb} broadcast signals. Both tasks are performed through a beam sweeping. In the proposed scheme, coordinated APs send sensing beams toward a grid of points within the volumetric surveillance region simultaneously with the 5G \Gls{ssb} burst. To prevent interference between communication and sensing signals, we propose a precoder design that guarantees orthogonality of the sensing beam and the \Gls{ssb} in order to maximize the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) while ensuring a specified SINR for users, as well as minimizing the impact of the direct link. The results demonstrate that the proposed precoder outperforms the non-coordinated precoder and is minimally affected by variations in drone altitude.
