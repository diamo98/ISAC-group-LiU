**Abstract of the paper.** Integrating sensing capabilities into existing massive MIMO communication networks has become crucial, stemming from a need for a more interconnected society. Improved coverage and performance can be obtained by incorporating new network components, such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces or network-controlled repeaters (NCR). Integrating such components into modern networks brings a number of challenges. Thus, this paper contributes with the analysis of NCR impact in integrated sensing and communication networks. Particularly, the Cramér-Rao bound for a range estimator is derived where the interference from the repeater is taken into consideration. Additionally, a joint procedure for determining the repeater amplification factor, along with the precoders of the transmitting access point, is proposed.
